# AGENTS.md — Vox Workspace Rules

---

## 0. MANDATORY RULE: AGENTS.md Sync Hook

> 🛑 **MANDATORY POST-TASK HOOK (NON-NEGOTIABLE) — TWO STEPS, IN ORDER:**
>
> **Step 1 — Always: Append to `AGENTS.md` Section 5 only.**
> After every completed task, add a concise bullet to Section 5 describing what changed. Do NOT simultaneously write to `docs/`, `recent_work.md`, or any other file — `AGENTS.md` is the only target.
>
> **Step 2 — Only when approaching 175 lines: Migrate Section 5.**
> After appending, check `AGENTS.md` total line count. If it is at or above **125 lines** (the warning threshold before the 175-line ceiling):
>
> 1. Migrate **only the delta**: append to `docs/plans/<current_phase>/recent_work.md` under a `## Past Work (YYYY-MM-DD)` heading just the Section 5 entries added since the last migration. Dedupe against the file first — never re-archive entries already present there (snapshotting the whole Section 5 duplicates history).
> 2. Replace Section 5 in `AGENTS.md` with a compact 3–5 bullet summary of only the highest-level milestones.
> 3. Keep the deep link at the top of Section 5: `📖 Full History: [recent_work.md](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/plans/<current_phase>/recent_work.md)`.
>
> **This is the complete hook. Nothing else is mandatory on every task.**

## 1. Project Context

Vox is a **realtime voice AI desktop app** (Tauri v2 / Rust / TypeScript). Constraint: 8GB RAM, CPU-first inference, sub-200ms perceived pipeline latency.

**Crate structure:** Single Rust library crate `vox_lib` at `app/src-tauri/`. `main.rs` is 1 line. `lib.rs` is module declarations + Tauri assembly only. All logic lives in modules.

## 3 Execution & Testing Invariants (All Agents)

1. **Sequential Execution:** Run performance-sensitive tasks (benchmarks, evals, test suites) strictly one at a time to prevent CPU, memory, and I/O contention.
2. **Release / Optimized Mode:** Always run performance measurements and benchmarks under release mode (`--release`). Debug builds produce invalid metrics.
3. **Isolated Test Runner (`cargo-nextest`):** Always use `cargo-nextest run` with explicit thread pool allocation and single-thread isolation:
   ```bash
   RAYON_NUM_THREADS=$(nproc) OMP_NUM_THREADS=$(nproc) cargo nextest run --release --test-threads=1
   ```
   _Single test:_ `cargo nextest run --test <test_file> --release --nocapture --test-threads=1`
   > ⏱️ **Full Suite Baseline Run Time:** ~34.5s test execution (~35s wall-clock with compilation cache hit; ~1m55s cold compile + run) across all 87 tests in 17 binaries (52 unit tests, 35 integration tests across Seams 1–11, 15–17, plus notifications CRUD).
4. **External API Keys (`#[ignore]`):** Cloud provider tests (Nvidia, Gemini Live, Deepgram, OpenAI, ElevenLabs) must be marked `#[ignore]` and run manually only with explicit user approval: `cargo nextest -- --ignored`.

## 4. Invariants ,Rules and Specs [MUST FOLLOW]

### 4.1 Critical Architectural & Logical Invariants (Non-Negotiable Concepts)

0. **Zero Backward Compatibility (ZBC):** Backward compatibility is not a requirement unless explicitly stated. Break, replace, or redesign existing interfaces when that produces the better architecture. Never introduce compatibility layers, legacy paths, or transitional abstractions proactively..
1. **Registry-Owned Event Contracts:** `core/events.rs` is the SSOT for all cross-boundary events. Internal pipeline events belong to `VoxEvent`; IPC events belong to `IpcEvent` with strongly typed payloads. Raw string event literals are forbidden at emit and listen sites; frontend mirrors the registry via `IpcEventMap`.
2. **Sacred Audio Hot Path:** Zero allocations, zero locks (`Mutex`/`RwLock`), zero blocking I/O on the CPAL audio thread and VAD inference loop. Ring buffers are lock-free, pre-allocated, and single-consumer (`VadActor` only — never attach secondary readers).
3. **Strict Frontend Service Boundary:** React components and hooks must never directly call `invoke`/`listen`. All backend interactions route through strongly-typed singleton service modules in `src/services/`.
4. **Centralized Monotonic Turn Lifecycle:** Turn IDs come exclusively from `PipelineAtomics::next_turn()` at turn boundaries as a `(turn_id, token)` bundle. Never reset to 0, fragment across actors, or fabricate dummies; subsystems receive the bundle, never advance the counter.
5. **Covered in style guides (not repeated here):** thread placement (inference on OS threads, Tokio for I/O), React 19 memoization + atomic selectors, strict import hoisting (`backend-style-guide.md §2.1`).

### 4.2. HARD GATE: Code Modification Gate

> 🛑 **MANDATORY CONTEXT GATE:**
>
> - **WRITE TASK (Backend Rust):** You MUST read `.agents/rules/backend-style-guide.md` AND `.agents/rules/backend-engineer.md` BEFORE modifying Rust backend code.
> - **WRITE TASK (Frontend React/TS):** You MUST read `.agents/rules/frontend-style-guide.md` AND `.agents/rules/frontend-engineer.md` BEFORE modifying frontend code.
> - **WRITE TASK (Tests/Benches/Evals):** You MUST read `.agents/rules/testing-style-guide.md` AND `.agents/rules/test-engineer.md` BEFORE authoring tests or benchmarks.
> - **READ-ONLY TASK (Auditing, answering questions, running tests/benchmarks, searching code):** DO NOT read code style files. Save context tokens.


### 4.3 Specifications, Behavioral Contracts & Non-Drift Hook [MANDATORY]

> 🛑 **MANDATORY SPEC ALIGNMENT HOOK (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
> Every agent working on Vox must adhere strictly to the approved specifications.
> 1. **Specification Divergence / Additions**: If an agent needs to implement, modify, or add behavior, commands, or schemas that diverge from or are not defined in the relevant spec, it MUST STOP and ask the user for approval. If approved, the agent MUST update the spec artifact FIRST before authoring or modifying code. Specifications must NEVER quietly drift from code.
> 2. **Code Divergence / Legacy Code**: If existing code implements nuances or legacy behaviors not defined in the spec, the agent MUST confirm with the user first before either pruning the code or updating the spec to capture the behavior.

#### Active Specifications Ledger
1. **[Event-Domain Architectural Specification (Ground Truth)](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/specs/events-spec.md)** — *Status: Approved SSOT*. Golden source of truth for pipeline behavior, state transitions, and 6-domain contracts.
2. **[Database & Persistence Specification (v2)](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/specs/db-spec.md)** — *Status: Approved Target Spec*. Strict persistence boundary, native Turso engine invariants, and normalized v2 schema.
3. **[Minimal Cognitive Memory & Session Continuation Spec (v2)](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/specs/memory-spec.md)** — *Status: Approved Target Spec*. 2-stage dedup, single evolving personal memory document, rolling working compaction, and deferred episodic tool retrieval.
4. **[IPC Command & Event Specification (v2)](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/specs/ipc-spec.md)** — *Status: Approved / Target Spec*. Grouped frontend-to-backend commands and backend-to-frontend IPC events.
5. **[LLM Agent Harness & Plugin Runtime Specification (v2)](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/specs/harness-spec.md)** — *Status: Approved Target Spec*. Plugin chassis, 1:1 session lifecycle (`start_session(Option<sessionId>)`), decoupled LLM actor with duplex dialogue pipe, `InteractionState::Working` with audio intent gating, and clean-slate deletion of legacy harness code.
6. **[Notification Center Behavioral & Interface Specification (v2)](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/specs/notifications-spec.md)** — *Status: Proposed Target Spec*. Append storage with correlation key, task idempotency, and frontend stream rollup.

## 5. Phase 11 Test Suite & Verification Ledger

> 📖 **Full History: [recent_work.md](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/plans/phase11/recent_work.md)** | Phase 10 Archive: [phase10/recent_work.md](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/plans/phase10/recent_work.md)

- **Phase 11 Seam Sprints Green (Seams 3, 5, 6, 7, 8):** Realtime WebSocket PTT agent, local Qwen GGUF duplex dialogue pipe, cognitive streaming clause chunking, Supertonic TTS playback cushion gating, and voice switching with critical compaction filler dispatch verified under `cargo nextest` with 100% mutation kills.
- **Memory v2 3D Cosmic Tree & Sentient Topology:** Replaced rigid quarterly cones with dynamic 360° Fibonacci tree canopy, curved cubic Bézier neural trunks, hollow gradient crystal core (custom Fresnel shader, geodesic wireframe, pulsing nucleus), and dedicated Select Mode toggle for misclick-free navigation; bottom-sheet markdown drawer with optimistic versioning.
- **Antigravity IDE Session Rail & Edge Panel Isolation:** Overhauled `SessionPanel.tsx` with Antigravity IDE aesthetics (+ New Conversation animation, drag-and-drop sessions into projects, vertical project reordering, three-dots menu for rename/move/pin/delete); isolated per-edge panel dismissal allowing concurrent left/right edge panels.
- **Turso Engine & Synthetic Dataset Ingestion:** Upgraded to `turso = "0.8.0-pre.11"` with isolated connection vending; synthesized and seeded 5,000 facts across 50 sessions in `vox.db` distributed across 6 domain projects.
- **Sprint 9 (Seam 9: Playback Lifecycle, Ducking & 6-Step Barge-In Sequence) verified:** Rebuilt `tests/playback_interrupt_test.rs` eliminating mock orchestration and tautological self-dispatch; Subtest 1 verified 12,000-sample pre-roll arming, real sink callback buffer drain, and autonomous `PlaybackFinished` emission transitioning `Speaking` → `Ready`; Subtests 2 & 3 verified short utterance pre-roll flush and pending jobs completion deferral; Subtests 4 & 5 verified real Earshot VAD ONNX speaker ducking suppression and Headset mode bypass; Subtest 6 verified canonical 6-step barge-in sequence via upstream `VoxEvent::PttStart` through `spawn_router`; verified 3.34s PASS and 100% mutation score (3/3 killed: Mutants 9.1, 9.2, 9.3); cargo check & clippy green.
- **Sprint 11 (Seam 11: Assistant Session Lifecycle & FSM) verified:** Rebuilt `tests/session_lifecycle_test.rs` against real Turso SQLite database (`vox.db`), central router event pump, and background persistence worker; verified 6/6 subtests in 1.07s (SessionStart persistence, continuation history hydration, pause/resume token & VAD transitions, sleeping/error recovery, dictation CPAL engine preservation gate, and session end unmounting); 100% mutation score (4/4 killed: Mutants 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4); cargo check green.
- **Notification Center Overhaul & In-Place Resolution:** Purged "tidy" terminology across workspace; implemented in-place interactive card resolution (`metadata.resolution`), minimal action icon buttons (`Sparkles`, `Brain`, `RotateCcw`, `Settings`) with hover tooltips and inline loader, Tasks vs Updates drawer tabs with scoped dismiss-all and auto-mark-read on open; enforced user dismissal sovereignty on boot (never resurrecting dismissed/resolved cards); added uncompacted session pulse indicator and compact action in session rail and history detail drawer; pnpm build, cargo check, clippy clean.
- **Quiet Ingestion Observer Hardening:** Updated `memory-spec.md §4.3` and `services/memory/mod.rs` (`spawn_quiet_ingestion_observer`); added `is_quiet_state` check covering `Idle`, `Ready`, `Paused`, `Sleeping` (aborting on active audio states); gated background cycles on `settings.memory.pipeline_processing_enabled`; added `has_unfinished_items` pre-check eliminating idle DB and log churn; cargo check & clippy clean.
