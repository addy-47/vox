# AGENTS.md — Vox Workspace Rules

---

## 1.. MANDATORY RULE: AGENTS.md Sync Hook

> 🛑 **MANDATORY POST-TASK HOOK (NON-NEGOTIABLE) — TWO STEPS, IN ORDER:**
>
> **Step 1 — Always: Append to `AGENTS.md` Section 5 only.**
> After every completed task, add a concise bullet to Section 5 describing what changed. Do NOT simultaneously write to `docs/`, `recent_work.md`, or any other file — `AGENTS.md` is the only target.
>
> **Step 2 — Only when approaching 175 lines: Migrate Section 5.**
> After appending, check `AGENTS.md` total line count. If it is at or above **110 lines** (the warning threshold before the 175-line ceiling):
>
> 1. Migrate **only the delta**: append to `docs/plans/<current_phase>/recent_work.md` under a `## Past Work (YYYY-MM-DD)` heading just the Section 5 entries added since the last migration. Dedupe against the file first — never re-archive entries already present there (snapshotting the whole Section 5 duplicates history).
> 2. Replace Section 5 in `AGENTS.md` with a compact 3–5 bullet summary of only the highest-level milestones.
> 3. Keep the deep link at the top of Section 5: `📖 Full History: [recent_work.md](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/plans/<current_phase>/recent_work.md)`.
>
> **This is the complete hook. Nothing else is mandatory on every task.**

## 3 Execution & Testing Invariants (All Agents)

1. **Sequential Execution with Release flag:** Run benchmarks, evals ,test suites or any cargo command strictly one at a time to prevent CPU, memory, and I/O contention and always use the `--release` flag.
2. **Isolated Test Runner (`cargo-nextest`):** Use the cmd listed below and its variations . 
   ```bash
   RAYON_NUM_THREADS=$(nproc) OMP_NUM_THREADS=$(nproc) cargo nextest run --release --test-threads=1 --no-fail-fast
   ```
   > ⏱️ **Full Suite Baseline Run Time:** ~45.5s test execution without cold compilation , always use a timeout or cron to monitor test runs and avoid hangs.
4. **Test with External Dependencies(`#[ignore]`):** Cloud or remote server tests must be run manually only with explicit user approval: `cargo nextest -- --ignored`.

## 4. Invariants ,Rules and Specs [MUST FOLLOW]

### 4.1 Critical Architectural & Logical Invariants (Non-Negotiable Concepts)
**Zero Backward Compatibility (ZBC):** Backward compatibility is not a requirement unless explicitly stated. Break, replace, or redesign existing interfaces when that produces the better architecture. Never introduce compatibility layers, legacy paths, 
> 🛑 **MANDATORY CONTEXT GATE:
**Exploration hook:** Before any codebase exploration, architecture lookup, graph query, or broad search, read `.agents/rules/codebase-memory-mcp.md` and follow its graph-first workflow.
>
**Local Turso Database CLI (`tursodb`):** For inspecting or querying the local Turso SQLite database (`~/.vox/vox.db`), use the native `tursodb` CLI tool:
   ```bash
   tursodb ~/.vox/vox.db "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';"
   ```

### 4.2. HARD GATE: Code Modification Gate

> 🛑 **MANDATORY CONTEXT GATE:**
> - **ANY WRITE TASK whether its Backend/Frontend/Tests:** You MUST read the corresponding style guide and engineer rule file for the specific area you are working on located in .agents/rules/.

### 4.3 Specifications, Behavioral Contracts & Non-Drift Hook [MANDATORY]

> 🛑 **MANDATORY SPEC ALIGNMENT HOOK (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
> Every agent working on Vox must adhere strictly to the approved specifications.
> 1. **Specification Divergence / Additions**: If an agent needs to implement, modify, or add behavior, commands, or schemas that diverge from or are not defined in the relevant spec, it MUST STOP and ask the user for approval. If approved, the agent MUST update the spec artifact FIRST before authoring or modifying code. Specifications must NEVER quietly drift from code.
> 2. **Code Divergence / Legacy Code**: If existing code implements nuances or legacy behaviors not defined in the spec, the agent MUST confirm with the user first before either pruning the code or updating the spec to capture the behavior.

#### Active Specifications Ledger
1. **[Event-Domain Architectural Specification (Ground Truth)](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/specs/events-spec.md)** — *Status: Approved SSOT*. Golden source of truth for pipeline behavior, state transitions, and 6-domain contracts.
2. **[Database & Persistence Specification (v2)](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/specs/db-spec.md)** — *Status: Approved Target Spec*. Strict persistence boundary, native Turso engine invariants, and normalized v2 schema.
3. **[Minimal Cognitive Memory & Session Continuation Spec (v2)](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/specs/memory-spec.md)** — *Status: Approved Target Spec*. 2-stage dedup, single evolving personal memory document, rolling working compaction, and deferred episodic tool retrieval.
4. **[IPC Command & Event Specification (v2)](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/specs/ipc-spec.md)** — *Status: Approved / Target Spec*. Grouped frontend-to-backend commands and backend-to-frontend IPC events.
5. **[LLM Agent Harness & Runtime Specification (v2)](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/specs/harness-spec.md)** — *Status: Approved Target Spec*.  chassis,session lifecycle, decoupled LLM actor with duplex dialogue pipe, `InteractionState::Working` with audio intent gating and tools wiring.
6. **[Notification Center Behavioral & Interface Specification (v2)](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/specs/notifications-spec.md)** — *Status: Approved Target Spec*. Append storage with correlation key, task idempotency, and frontend stream rollup.
7. **[Agentic Tools & Tool Runtime Specification (v1)](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/specs/tools-spec.md )** — *Status: Approved Target Spec*. Dual classification (`Terminal  vs Non-Terminal`), capability gating, RRF hybrid retrieval, and scratchpad rollback.

## 5. Phase 12 — Recent Work Summary

> 📖 **Full History:** [recent_work.md](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/plans/phase12/recent_work.md) | Phase 11 Archive: [phase11/recent_work.md](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/plans/phase11/recent_work.md)

- **Agentic runtime & provider SSOT shipped:** Full tool taxonomy, reentrant cognitive loop, session gating, provider wire policy mapping, and 122 integration tests with 73% mutation kill rate.
- **Web search & tool ecosystem:** Built and published `nexuss` (v0.1.1 on crates.io), wired `web_search` with adaptive fanout quorum and hybrid ranking (2.16s latency), verified across Seam 21 tests and live Gemini eval.
- **Memory pipeline eval & manual verification:** 14-case eval suite, semantic grounding audits, compaction prompt hardening, Turso sidecar anchor diagnostics, and manual query playbooks.
- **Settings desk & UI design system overhaul:** Rebuilt LLM/VAD/ASR/TTS tabs into 65-35 two-column desks with custom wireframe vector SVGs; replaced legacy pill toggles with vector state controls (`WebSearchGlobe`, `Clock`, `TransliterationToggle`); aligned overlay styling across `/home`, `/settings`, and `/memory`.
- **Interaction & session fixes:** Scoped idle overlays, decoupled Orb Stage pointer handlers from PTT so clicking the visual orb no longer triggers listening state, fixed engage/disengage transitions, and added 2-step restore confirmation.
- **Memory RSS discrepancy RCA:** Reconciled stale runtime-only RSS against host usage using live `/proc`, cgroup, PSS, swap, and allocator evidence; identified excluded Tauri dev processes, RSS shared-page double counting, eager model/ORT memory, and WebKit shmem/DMA-BUF accounting.
- **Controlled idle-only memory benchmark:** Ran four untouched 60–70 second launch cycles plus a WebKit renderer A/B; measured 686 MB Vox RSS / 470 MB PSS, 1.08 GB full-dev PSS, and a 1.61 GB scope with 729 MB shmem, while forced WebKit SHM reduced scope RAM to 1.08 GB and shmem to 206 MB.
- **Ambient background tuning & speech pause fix:** Increased base ripple cycle duration (calm 24s -> 28s) for wider emission spacing; slowed ripples down by 25% on History (`1.25x`) and 50% on Settings (`1.5x`) via `rippleSpeedMultiplier`; confirmed `paused={interactionState === "Speaking"}` was retained in `ResponsiveLayout` but ineffective due to uninherited child CSS animation-play-state; fixed by adding `.is-paused` container class, smooth 0.8s opacity fade-out, and explicit paused state on `.rp-ring` and `.amb-blob`.
- **Full-scope monitoring design:** Classified WebKit SHM and visual-idle gating as trade-offs and excluded them; defined a debug-only profiler scope breakdown plus cgroup-backed full CPU/RAM semantics for the existing monitoring metrics, with no visual or UI behavior changes.
- **Structured delta memory consolidation & suggestion review design:** Solved anchor erosion from full-document Markdown rewrites by establishing a structured patch protocol (`replace`, `insert`, `delete`), eliminating fragile line numbers and `reason` clutter; updated `memory-spec.md`, `db-spec.md`, and `ipc-spec.md` with `personal_memory_suggestions`, `'staged'`/`'rejected'` fact lifecycles, and polymorphic `resolve_memory_suggestion(id, action)`; authored backend implementation plan and checklist.
