# AGENTS.md — Vox Workspace Rules

---

## 0. MANDATORY RULE: AGENTS.md Sync Hook

> 🛑 **MANDATORY POST-TASK HOOK (NON-NEGOTIABLE) — TWO STEPS, IN ORDER:**
>
> **Step 1 — Always: Append to `AGENTS.md` Section 5 only.**
> After every completed task, add a concise bullet to Section 5 describing what changed. Do NOT simultaneously write to `docs/`, `recent_work.md`, or any other file — `AGENTS.md` is the only target.
>
> **Step 2 — Only when approaching 175 lines: Migrate Section 5.**
> After appending, check `AGENTS.md` total line count. If it is at or above **125 lines** (the warning threshold before the 175-line ceiling):
> 1. Write the **full, uncompacted** current Section 5 content to `docs/plans/<current_phase>/recent_work.md`.
> 2. Replace Section 5 in `AGENTS.md` with a compact 3–5 bullet summary of only the highest-level milestones.
> 3. Add a deep link at the top of Section 5: `📖 Full History: [recent_work.md](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/plans/<current_phase>/recent_work.md)`.
>
> **This is the complete hook. Nothing else is mandatory on every task.**

## 1. Project Context

Vox is a **realtime voice AI desktop app** (Tauri v2 / Rust / TypeScript). Constraint: 8GB RAM, CPU-first inference, sub-200ms perceived pipeline latency.

**Crate structure:** Single Rust library crate `vox_lib` at `app/src-tauri/`. `main.rs` is 1 line. `lib.rs` is module declarations + Tauri assembly only. All logic lives in modules.

## 2. Workspace Directory Map

## 3 Execution & Testing Invariants (All Agents)

1. **Sequential Execution:** Run performance-sensitive tasks (benchmarks, evals, test suites) strictly one at a time to prevent CPU, memory, and I/O contention.
2. **Release / Optimized Mode:** Always run performance measurements and benchmarks under release mode (`--release`). Debug builds produce invalid metrics.
3. **Isolated Test Runner (`cargo-nextest`):** Always use `cargo-nextest run` with explicit thread pool allocation and single-thread isolation:
   ```bash
   RAYON_NUM_THREADS=$(nproc) OMP_NUM_THREADS=$(nproc) cargo nextest run --release --test-threads=1
   ```
   _Single test:_ `cargo nextest run --test <test_file> --release --nocapture --test-threads=1`  
4. **External API Keys (`#[ignore]`):** Cloud provider tests (Nvidia, Gemini Live, Deepgram, OpenAI, ElevenLabs) must be marked `#[ignore]` and run manually only with explicit user approval: `cargo nextest -- --ignored`.

## 4. Invariants and Workflow Gates

### 4.1 Critical Architectural & Logical Invariants (Non-Negotiable Concepts)

0. **Zero Backward Compatibility (ZBC):** Backward compatibility is not a requirement unless explicitly stated. Break, replace, or redesign existing interfaces when that produces the better architecture. Never introduce compatibility layers, legacy paths, or transitional abstractions proactively..
1. **Single Source of Truth for State:** `InteractionState` (`Idle, Ready, Listening, Thinking, Speaking, Paused, Error`) and `DictationState` (`Idle, Recording, Transcribing, Error`) are the sole sources of truth. Synthetic lifecycle booleans (`is_engaged`, `is_recording`, `is_connected`, `is_speaking`, `is_sleeping` are strictly banned across Rust and TypeScript.
2. **Registry-Owned Event Contracts:** `core/events.rs` is the SSOT for all cross-boundary events. Internal pipeline events belong to `VoxEvent`; IPC events belong to `IpcEvent` with strongly typed payloads. Raw string event literals are forbidden at emit and listen sites; frontend mirrors the registry via `IpcEventMap`.
3. **Sacred Audio Hot Path:** Zero dynamic memory allocations, zero lock acquisitions (`Mutex`/`RwLock`), and zero blocking I/O on the CPAL audio thread and VAD inference loop. Ring buffers must be lock-free and pre-allocated.
4. **Actor-Engine Separation & Thread Isolation:** CPU/GPU-heavy model inference (Whisper STT, ONNX VAD, Llama LLM, Chatterbox TTS) runs strictly on dedicated background OS threads (`std::thread`). Tokio runtime is reserved strictly for async I/O, IPC routing, and network WebSockets.
5. **Strict Frontend Service Boundary:** React components and hooks must never directly call `@tauri-apps/api/core` (`invoke`) or `@tauri-apps/api/event` (`listen`). All backend interactions must route through strongly-typed singleton service modules in `src/services/`.
6. **React 19 Context Memoization & Selector Discipline:** Provider values must be wrapped in `useMemo`. Zustand store state must be queried via fine-grained atomic selectors (`(s) => s.field`) rather than consuming entire store snapshots, preventing cascading render loops.
7. **Centralized Monotonic Turn Lifecycle:** Monotonic turn IDs must be generated exclusively at turn boundaries via `PipelineAtomics::next_turn()`, which atomically advances the turn ID, renews the `CancellationToken`, and returns `(turn_id, token)` as a bundle. Turn IDs must never be reset to 0, fragmented across parallel actors, or fabricated with dummy values. Subsystems receive `(turn_id, token)` at the turn boundary — they never own or directly advance the underlying `AtomicU32`.
8. **Single-Consumer Audio Stream Invariant:** Audio ring buffers and input channels must have exactly one consumer (`VadActor`). Never attach secondary or ad-hoc readers to production audio streams.

### 4.2. HARD GATE: Code Modification Gate

> 🛑 **MANDATORY CONTEXT GATE:**
>
> - **WRITE TASK (Backend Rust):** You MUST read `.agents/rules/backend-style-guide.md` AND `.agents/rules/backend-engineer.md` BEFORE modifying Rust backend code.
> - **WRITE TASK (Frontend React/TS):** You MUST read `.agents/rules/frontend-style-guide.md` AND `.agents/rules/frontend-engineer.md` BEFORE modifying frontend code.
> - **WRITE TASK (Tests/Benches/Evals):** You MUST read `.agents/rules/testing-style-guide.md` AND `.agents/rules/test-engineer.md` BEFORE authoring tests or benchmarks.
> - **READ-ONLY TASK (Auditing, answering questions, running tests/benchmarks, searching code):** DO NOT read code style files. Save context tokens.

## 5. Phase 11 Test Suite & Verification Ledger

> 📖 **Full History: [recent_work.md](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/plans/phase11/recent_work.md)** | Phase 10 Archive: [phase10/recent_work.md](file:///home/addy/projects/apps/vox/docs/plans/phase10/recent_work.md)

- **Phase 10 Concluded → Phase 11 Initialized:** 4-domain pipeline refactor, realtime driver decomposition, hot-path zero-alloc pools, and `services/audio/` separation (zero clippy warnings); Phase 11 scope is full test-suite engineering (UT/IT/benchmarks/evals).
- **Dynamic Model Hub + Settings passes:** Id-driven manifest v1.6.0 in 3 places (`provider` keys deleted), backend `ProviderCaps` + UT, full-body Model|Settings toggle, caps-driven voice/speed panes; followed by visual-harmony, ergonomics, iconography, and STT/TTS compute-allocation passes — all `tsc`/`clippy`/`pnpm build` green.
- **Memory Compaction & IPC Consolidation:** DB Schema v2 (`session_compactions` + `notifications`), `CompactionCoordinator` with Idle/Paused guard, boot crash-recovery, Bell action cards; `ipc/memory.rs` consolidation, `persistence/graph.rs` domain separation, GTK focus/toast/boot fixes.
- **Voice Wiring Audit + Frontend Full Sweep (no code changed):** `voice_wiring_audit.md` (tray-clear bug, VAD/CPAL `dictation.enabled` gap, 11 arg-case mismatches, CPAL drop-gate design) and `frontend_review.md` (22 🔴 incl. hook-order violations, ingestion-pause divergence, phantom toggles; feedback-review confirmed 20/20); fix order: key renames + tests, hook crash class, settings truthfulness.
- **Frontend & Voice Wiring Sprint Executions Green:** Fixed 11 Tauri IPC arg-case mismatches across `services/` & tests, resolved `llm_token` streaming accumulator overwrite (`+=`), inverted `toggle_pipeline_processing` parameter to `{ enabled }`, rectified conditional hook ordering in settings components, bound notification listeners into `eventsService`, cleaned phantom realtime toggles, guarded STT cloud preview selection, wired `?tab=` deep linking, enabled mic-missing onboarding continuation, and optimized LLM health check dependencies (`tsc`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build` 100% green).
- **Frontend State Authority & Tray Clearing Enforced:** Removed optimistic local `setInteractionState` flips in `engage`, `disengage`, `pause`, and `resume` in `VoiceSessionContext.tsx`, making UI interaction state 100% driven by backend IPC `state_changed` events (Invariant §4.1.1); added `setDialogueHistory([])` and turn counter reset on `disengage()` per the approved tray spec (`tsc` green).
